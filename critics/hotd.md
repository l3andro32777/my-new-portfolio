And it is with great regret that the 1st season of this GREAT show ends...

The works of George R.R. Martin are really unique and the productions of this Universe, by HBO, have the ability to make our hearts leap, from beginning to end.

Each relationship established with the characters, each emotion caused become special.

Intensity and tension were not lacking and this last episode was no different, having been the most tense of all.

Undoubtedly, the show of the year and, definitely, of the next years to come, until its conclusion.

“Fire and Blood” present in everything.

Incredible...

PS: now it's time to wait for Season 2...
